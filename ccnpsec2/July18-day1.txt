TASK1: learn C-I-A
Confidentiality:
-1st goal:
- data is not visible to just anyone and protect data i storage or in motion
  thus protecting business data.
- data is for intended and authorized persons
- encryption protects: data/system confidentiality
- RAS and S2S VPN protects data in transit

DEMO: ras, site 2 site and storage encryption.

use bitlocker to go, to encrypt usb harddrive.
 
Integrity:
-Ensures maintaining and assuring accuracy of consistent data
-Ability to make sure that has not been altered or changed/data is Orig!
-data recieved is the SAMe as the data sent by the sender

Demo: md5 or sha1/sha256

Availability:
- systems, Applications, Data must be avialable to users
- resilient systems, virtualization, clustering, enviromentalt controls
  and incident response
  
DFS and Clustering demo  
  
C: data private/secure + I:data not changed + A: can access data

Task2: Protect digital assests;

building, vehichel, machines, laptops, Ingible assest:

task2.1: Vulnerability: cve database
is a weakness in asystem or its design, every system is human create thus
prone to erros, there are vulnerabilities in apps, network protocols,
OS, etc. an attacker can gain acces to a organization thru exploits


https://cve.mitre.org

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-1338

Task2.2: Exploit:

conf t
int vlan 1
ip add 10.1.0.4 255.255.255.0
no shut
exit
ip http server
line vty 0 14

username admin privilege 15 password pass

use wireshark:

filter: http
        GET

Exploits: are ways used to attack a vulnerability to cause damage to a systems,
can be buffer overflow or social eng to hack a password.

Threat: are anything dagner to an asset:
key loggers, spyware, hackers, virues, lockups, data lost, identify theft,
trojan, root kits, etc..

Attack: 

Risks: = Asset + threat + vulnerability

CounterMeasure:  is an action initiated by the organizatiopn typically to mititgate
  a threat.
  
telnet, http, snmp --> https(contermeasure)

"explain" Cisco of RISK

Task3: On-premise vs On-cloud:

Cloud: 
is hosted on servers by aws, azure, gcp
3rd party responsible for managing and securing Infa

On pre vs Iaas   vs  Paas  vs  Saas (Infographic)

Malware: 
malicious Software is a file or code or app.
Malware: adware, scareware, botnets, logicbombs, keyloggers, etc..
virus, wordms, trojans, rootkits, Spyware.

Virus: 'create a virus!"
- malicios code at attach needs human toactivate it.

Worms: are malware that replicate themselves and spread to infect other systems

Adware:  https://geekprank.com/

RansomeWare: "demo"

Keylogger: blackboxexpress

DEMO: 
Sql injection
and
XSS scripting
